Both logistic regression and decision tree models exhibited similar discriminatory power, with comparable ROC AUC and precision–recall behavior. Given this similarity, logistic regression was selected as the primary model due to its superior interpretability and stability, which are critical in credit risk applications.

The decision threshold was set to 0.4. Compared to the conventional 0.5 threshold, this choice increases recall of defaulters by approximately 9 percentage points, at the cost of a higher false-positive rate. This tradeoff reflects a risk-averse policy, where the cost of missing a defaulter is considered higher than the cost of flagging additional non-defaulters for review. Such an operating point is consistent with conservative credit risk management practices.
